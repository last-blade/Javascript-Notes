## Introduction
JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language that allows developers to create interactive and dynamic content on web pages. This repository contains notes that cover key JavaScript concepts and practical examples.

## Variables and Data Types
Understand how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`, and explore the different data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

## Operators
Learn about arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators, as well as the use of ternary operators and short-circuit evaluation.

## Functions
Master function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and higher-order functions. Understand scope, closures, and the concept of `this`.

## Control Structures
Explore JavaScript control flow statements like `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and `try-catch` for error handling.

## Objects and Arrays
Understand how to create and manipulate objects and arrays, including methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and object destructuring.

## Asynchronous JavaScript
Dive into asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, async/await, and the event loop. Learn how to handle asynchronous data using APIs like `fetch`.

## DOM Manipulation
Learn how to interact with and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. Understand methods like `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, and event handling.

## ES6+ Features
Explore modern JavaScript features introduced in ES6 and beyond, such as template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, modules, and more.

## Best Practices
- Use `let` and `const` instead of `var`.
- Avoid polluting the global scope.
- Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Write modular and reusable code.
