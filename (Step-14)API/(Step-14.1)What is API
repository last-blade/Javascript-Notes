-->In simple terms, an API (Application Programming Interface) is like a waiter at a restaurant. Imagine you're at a
restaurant and you want to order food. You don't go into the kitchen and cook it yourself; instead, you tell the waiter
what you want, and they bring it to you.


-->Similarly, in computing, an API is like a waiter that helps different software programs communicate with each other. It
defines a set of rules and protocols that allow one piece of software to interact with another. Just like you tell the
waiter what you want to eat and how you want it prepared, you use an API to tell a program what you want it to do and 
how you want it to do it.

-->For example, when you use a weather app on your phone, it's likely getting its weather data from a weather API. The
app sends a request to the API, asking for the weather forecast for a specific location, and the API responds with 
the requested information, which the app then displays to you.

-->So, an API essentially acts as an intermediary that allows different software programs to talk to each other and share 
information or perform tasks without needing to know how each other works internally.
