DOM:-Jo humara HTML kaa code hota hai....uske JS object mein convert ho jaane ke baad hum usse DOM kehte hain i.e., agar
    main apne poore HTML code ko JS object mein convert kardun toh main usko hi DOM kehta hoon.
    A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.
    In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated.

    Agar hum kisi bhi webpage ko jaake 'inspect' karenge or uske console mein jaake 'document' type karke enter maarenge toh fir
    mujhe poora HTML kaa code display ho jaayega or issi HTML code ko hum Document keh rahe hain. 
    For more detaile, see the 'DOM Tree' image in this folder



Window:-The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document. It is a top level entity.



BOM:- The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of objects exposed by the browser that allow JavaScript
       to interact with the browser window, document, and other browser-specific functionalities. The BOM includes
       objects such as Window, Navigator, Location, History, and Screen.
